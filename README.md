# Movie-Database-Software
A database application to give a simple GUI to a movie database.
<br />This was developed for an Introduction to Databases course as a team end-of-semester project.

**Technologies used:** Java, XML, CSS, MySQL

**Team Members:** Jack Parker & Dakota Kallas

**How to run:**
<br />In order to run the project you must have the JavaFX GUI package installed on your machine.
<br />Once it is installed, you will be able to run the Main.java file in the src/application directory.
<br />You will then need to setup a localhost database connection on MySQL Workbench using the data importer of the database dump in the database directory as a new "mmdb" schema.
<br />_Note: You will need to match the JDBC connection settings used in the DBUtils.java class._

All project files can be found in the main branch.
